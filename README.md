<br/>
Uses <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy's library</a>. <br/>


## Configuration
1. Prepare the virtual environment
```sh
source ./install.sh
```
2. Create the file with your credentials
```sh
touch .env
echo IST_ID=istxxxxx >> .env
echo FENIX_PASSWORD=your_password >> .env
```

```sh
vim config.toml
```


## Running
Download the files + organize the downloads into the organized folder

## Extra notes
- Please do not change the download delay to something that can create too many requests to the servers
